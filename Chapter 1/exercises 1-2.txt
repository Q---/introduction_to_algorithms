Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

The obvious example is route navigation systems, which optimize road routes through various optional criteria (e.g. distance, time, toll-cost, gas usage).  This is done through the minimum path algorithm, I assume.

Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine.  For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in 8n^2 steps, while merge sort runs in 64nlg(n) steps.  For which values of n does insertion sort beat merge sort?

For number of inputs below or equal to 43, insertion sort is faster than merge sort.  The algebraic solution requires the Lambert W function.

What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is 100n^2 runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2^n on the same machine?

    100n^2    2^n
13  16900     8196
14  19600     16384
15  22500     32768

The smallest number of inputs such that algorithm A is faster than algorithm B is 15.
